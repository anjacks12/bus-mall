# Lab-11

## BusMall

The purpose of this app is to display three items side by side to allow the user to vote by clicking on the item they would most likely purchase. The number of times each item is displayed along with the number of clicks (votes) each item receives is saved and stored to be displayed to the user after 25 clicks/votes have been made

###### Reflections and Comments

* Day 1: I didn't get very far on this lab; Hopefully I'll get a chance to review this weekend and work on it more
* Day 2: Worked on lab some more; Got help from Sheyna on how to get results to render after voting was done; Got help from Andres in class with the code challenge replit that helped me set up the random item generation
* Day 3: Finished adding the chart to the BusMall lab; I need to go back to Day 2 and make some fixes on that lab for resubmit
