## Description

The purpose of this app is to display three items side by side to allow the user to vote by clicking on the item they would most likely purchase. The number of times each item is displayed along with the number of clicks (votes) each item receives is saved and stored to be displayed to the user after 25 clicks/votes have been made

### Reflections and Comments

* 15 Jan 2022: I didn't get very far on this lab; Hopefully I'll get a chance to review this weekend and work on it more
* 17 Jan 2022: Worked on lab some more; Got help from Sheyna on how to get results to render after voting was done; Got help from Andres in class with the code challenge repl.it that helped me set up the random item generation
* 20 Jan 2022: Finished adding the chart to the BusMall lab; I need to go back to Day 2 and make some fixes on that lab for resubmit
* 22 Jan 2022: I didn't finish the lab today and didn't make much headway either; I was able get the things stored but when pulling them out of storage, the number of likes and views didn't match up and I'm not sure why that is
* 22 Jan 2022: I messed up on the pull request for the lab 11 resubmit so I had to create a dummy branch to store my code to resubmit the lab
* 29 Jan 2022: Finished the Busmall lab with Sheyna's help
